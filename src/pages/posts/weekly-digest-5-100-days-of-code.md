100 days of code was started by _Alexander Kallaway_ in 2016 but recently it has been gaining more momentum (we all know why). Practice is the only way to master any discipline so if you have been thinking about joining the challenge, I have compiled a list of project ideas to help you get started.

### Wait, explain me more about this 100 days of code challenge

`TL;DR:` code at least 1 hour per day for 100 days. You can learn more about it from the [original post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4/) or check out the [official website](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

### Project inspiration:

There are some of the projects/challenges I have my eye on:

- Wes Bos has a free course called [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/). It has 30 challenges including CSS, HTML and Javascript topics.
- Building a nice online resume is always another good opportunity. Check out this [react-ultimate-resume GitHub project](https://github.com/welovedevs/react-ultimate-resume).
- Maybe something smaller, like building a [calculator](https://reactjsexample.com/a-working-calculator-in-react-and-typescript/)?
- Or an [alarm clock](https://medium.com/@rakeshbhatt/alarm-clock-using-alpinejs-de1e39f972e3) while learning [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) (yet another rendering library flavor!!!!).
- Are you into games? Check this nice [chessboard-element react project](https://justinfagnani.github.io/chessboard-element/) or this [Codenames game replica](https://ninjabunny.github.io/KodeNames/).
- If none of them inspired you yet, check this list of [creative JS GitHub projects](https://dev.to/lindelof/10-very-creative-javascript-projects-on-github-1j0n) or this [coding challenges websites list](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-10-most-popular-coding-challenge-websites-of-2016-fb8a5672d22f/).

### Make them look nice

Sometimes while working on projects it is hard to have a nice finished and polished UI. But we can always use [bootstrap UI kits](https://themesberg.com/blog/ui-kits/top-10-free-bootstrap-ui-kits-for-2020) or even maybe go retro and leverage this [Windows 95 UI kit](https://themesberg.com/product/ui-kits/windows-95-ui-kit).

Enjoy!!
