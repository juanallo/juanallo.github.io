- Best practices on JavaScript modularity: when to use named exports, how to group code and what to avoid. Check [JavaScript Module Best Practices](https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-modules-best-practices/).
- Understanding the proxy pattern and adding that to your toolbox is super useful. In the past I have used proxies for multiple purposes (logging, performance, caching results). Learn more about JavaScript proxy in [JavaScript Proxy Object Explained post](https://areknawo.com/javascript-proxy-object-explained/).
- Have you read "JavaScript: the good parts"? Check this article on [The Magic Behind JavaScript Sintaxis Shortcuts](https://areknawo.com/the-magic-behind-javascript-syntax-shortcuts/) to learn more about not so good practices (well except maybe ternary operator)
- Planning to try all this out? Check this article on best online IDEs: [12+ Best Online Code Editors for Web Developers](https://flatlogic.com/blog/12-best-online-code-editors-for-web-developers/). I recommend [Stack blitz](https://stackblitz.com/) (it is vs code online)
- Let's finish with some js basics. Here's an article that quickly explains how to declare variables: [JavaScript Variables: var and let and const](https://www.prestonlamb.com/blog/javascript-variables-var-and-let-and-const). I tend to agree with the statements made in the article, const is your ally but there is one caveat that you need to understand. A value declared in a const cannot be mutated, but objects or arrays are always mutable constructs, so while you can declare an object or an array as a const it is possible to mutate its properties/items. It only won't be posible to assign something else to that const!

Enjoy!!!
