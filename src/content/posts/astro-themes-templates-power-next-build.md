Part of Astro's appeal lies with its active community supporting each other. So I had to spotlight the work of fellow fans pushing possibilities:

- [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/top-23-free-astro-themes-for-building-out-of-this-world-static-sites-in-2023/) curated Astro-specific galleries so you can filter quality templates in one spot.
