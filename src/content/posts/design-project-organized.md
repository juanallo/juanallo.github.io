Based on atomic design principles I will share to you a methodology to organize design projects. I been reading about atomic design for a while and I think it is a perfect idea to bring concepts like, divide and conquer and re-usability to design. Today I found [an article](http://www.aisleone.net/2015/ui-design/systematic-design/ "Systematic design") explaining an approach to organize projects based on atomic design and I want to try it!

In order to help myself and apply it I made a cheat-sheet that explains the different concepts and how the design project should be structured.

It is crucial to communicate the system to the whole team you work with, so we can all be in the same page and also, to make work collaboration smooth. Big tutorials and presentations can help to incorporate this concepts but when it comes to the day to day work it is better to have something simple and visual.
