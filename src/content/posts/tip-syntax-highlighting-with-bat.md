Terminal command `cat` is a standard tool to print file contents to the console. I use it all the time but recently I found `bat` and it changed my life!

`bat` will also print file contents but provides syntax highlighting. If you use Homebrew it is super easy to install:

```bash
brew install bat
```

Here is an example of how the output will look like compared to cat:

Enjoy!!
