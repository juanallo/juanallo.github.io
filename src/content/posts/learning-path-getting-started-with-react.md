Not long ago I started learning React. I have more than 10 years of experience using JS and before React I was actively coding in first wave generation web frameworks (like knockoutJS) and starting to get a grasp on components architecture (but using KO components + web components). Today I am coding entirely in React (both at work and for personal projects) and itâ€™s been great. I love the community, there are a lot of projects & learning resources and I also found React to be a fast way of creating web applications.

In this post I want to share some resources that helped me learn React and I hope they are useful for anyone starting out there.

<p class="note">To be more effective in this learning path, intermediate knowledge on JS, HTML and CSS is recommended. If you are not there yet, you might want to take it at a slower pace and maybe mix it with some tutorials on JS, HTML and CSS basics.
Also make sure that you are familiar with newer JS concepts. Check <a class="highlight" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react)" target="_blank">Javascript to know for React </a>as a refresher.

Before we begin it is important to understand what React is. This [Introduction to ReactJS video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycstRj2i66k) explains it in a nice and concise way. Also, if you want to understand better why React is a library and not a framework, check this chapter on [What React Is and Why it Matters by Eric Baer](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-react-is/9781491996744/ch01.html).

Letâ€™s continue with the [official React website](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) as it has solid documentation and tutorials. I find myself checking the official site here and there to reinforce core concepts of the language. If I had to recommend 2 sections from the official docs those would be:

- [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html): Explains a simple process to design and implement UI with this library.
- [Design Principles](https://reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html): Understanding the reasoning behind React also helps to reason about the features and practices.

After following these docs it is time to watch some videos. I recommend 2 React tutorials:

- [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/): Super complete tutorial where you code along. It is not free, but usually you can get it for \$10 USD which is not bad.
- Going a little bit more advanced, there is a training course by Wes Bos called [Fullstack Advanced React & GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com/). This one is more expensive ~\$50-70 USD but it goes a little bit deeper, you will end up doing a full web application (uses an e-commerce example). It will not only walk you through React but also a solid stack (NextJS, Apollo, GQL Yoga and Prisma).
- If you are looking for free options check this article on [10 free courses to learn React](https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-free-courses-to-learn-react-js-c14edbd3b35f).

Now is a good time to check that some core principles are solid. Refresh some concepts by checking these articles:

- [React concepts you should know](https://medium.com/@ornob011/react-concepts-you-should-know-1c95897c237a)
- [Top 10 important things of React](https://medium.com/@shakilatrai5/top-ten-important-things-of-react-9df21911f5ff)
- [Important topics of React](https://medium.com/@shrikantamazumder/important-topics-of-react-7f7afaf8bf0)
- Also check this [React cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/react)

You are never finished until you tested your app. Here are some resources to help you learn more about testing:

- [React Testing crash course](https://dev.to/emarsys/react-testing-crash-course-ccl).
- At this point you probably know about [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/). He has amazing resources and recommendations on how to test React apps. Also he created the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/intro), check his [article](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/introducing-the-react-testing-library) introducing it.
- I am more a fan of [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) but I will let arrive to your own conclusions ðŸ™‚

If you are still excited to continue learning is time to dig into[ React internals](https://juanmanuelalloron.com/2020/04/12/weekly-digest-4-on-react-internals). Also check this [talk on how react concurrent mode works](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/react-from-scratch).

A bonus resource is this awesome [React GitHub resources repo](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react) which has tons of links to keep learning and building your path!

Enjoy!!
