Hi there,

It has always been a dream of my wife and me to travel around the world. There is so much to see and so many beautiful places, cultures, and great food! At the beginning of the year, we had the opportunity to make that dream come true. We traversed four continents, visiting numerous places and trying diverse food for five incredible months. It has been an amazing experience, and I am genuinely glad we embarked on this journey!

Now, we are back in California, and I just started working as a Principal Frontend Software engineer for Atlassian.

As I dive into Atlassian and Enterprise Agility, I'm also delving into the depths of the web, frontend development and immersing myself in the world of AI. And guess what? I'm sharing the journey right here on this blog.

My plan is to learn in public and use my blog to share what Iâ€™ve been learning. No rocket science, just plain old exploration and discovery.

Stay tuned and join me as we dive headfirst into the web, one blog post at a time.
