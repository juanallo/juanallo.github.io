Hi there,

It has always been a dream of my wife and me to travel around the world. There is so much to see and so many beautiful places, cultures, and great food! At the beginning of the year, we had the opportunity to make that dream come true. We traversed four continents, visiting numerous places and trying diverse food for five incredible months. It has been an amazing experience, and I am genuinely glad we embarked on this journey!

Now, we are back in California, and itâ€™s time to start looking for my next professional adventure. During those five months, I tried to stay away from tech as much as possible to connect with the trip itself. Now, coming back, I feel a little bit rusty ðŸ˜›.

As I dive into the job hunt for the next exciting chapter, I'm also delving into the depths of the web, brushing up on interviews, and immersing myself in the world of AI. And guess what? I'm sharing the journey right here on this blog.

My plan is to learn in public and use my blog to share what Iâ€™ve been learning. No rocket science, just plain old exploration and discovery.

Stay tuned and join me as we dive headfirst into the web, one blog post at a time.
