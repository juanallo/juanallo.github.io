Iâ€™ve been playing quite a bit with LLMs and while they are great at producing text you can also do other things with some tricks. 

In this experiment I created a text notation so ChatGPT, [Claude.AI](http://Claude.AI) and Bard could create some music with it. 

NOTE: I donâ€™t know how to play the drums myself, so some of this might be wrong. Feel free to message me at [juan_allo](https://twitter.com/juan_allo) and Iâ€™ll make updates!

The basic prompt goes like this:

```
You are a drums expert. I am going to give you a notation and we are going to write some music together.
Let's say letters represent sounds.

[ { "key": "A", "sound": "clap" }, { "key": "S", "sound": "hihat" }, { "key": "D", "sound": "kick" }, { "key": "F", "sound": "openhat" }, { "key": "G", "sound": "boom" }, { "key": "H", "sound": "ride" }, { "key": "J", "sound": "snare" }, { "key": "K", "sound": "tom" }, { "key": "L", "sound": "tink" } ]

- You can also use P to represent a pause.
- A song is written in a line.
- You can use multiple lines to represent sounds that are played at the same time.
- No spaces better the letters.
- You can use / to represent different sections.
```

A song example would look like the following:

```
DPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDPDP
SPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSPSP
JPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJP
```

Like a simple roll pattern doing the Kick, the Hi-Hat and the Snare at the same time

## ðŸŽ® The Player's Interface: From Wes Bos to Sonic Bliss

Why stick to the mundane when you can groove with the keys? I borrowed inspiration from Wes Bos's Javascript 30 challengeâ€”the Drum Kit. The result? An interactive interface where you can not only visualize but play the drums using your keyboard. Pure auditory and visual ecstasy!

## Next Steps

This is only the beginning, I would like to explore creating a whole UI that will generate music from a prompt!

I also want to add a little bit more complexity to the notation. You are still missing the tempo (right now I am using a 200ms delay between sounds)

## Learnings

Some LLMs were better at understanding and following of the notation than others. For example [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) picked it right away and it even produced some nice improvs.

Doing covers hasnâ€™t worked well yet. I asked all the LLMs to make a cover of Wipe Out (The Surfaris) and none produced something close. 

I tried upload drum sheets to Bard and it kind of produced the song in these notation. Something to definitely keep exploring.
