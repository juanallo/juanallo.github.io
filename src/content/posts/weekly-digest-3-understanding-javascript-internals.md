In this weekly digest I want to focus on resources that have helped me learn Javascript inner workings. In order to master any coding language it is necessary to understand how it works.

- To understand better the language check [Advanced Javascript by Kyle Simpson](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/advanced-javascript), it has helped me to finally understand how `this` works!! The videos focus on `scopes` (lexical vs dynamic),`closures`, \`prototypal Inheritance\`, and \`async patterns\`
- Let's dig into the JS engine on [JavaScript Visualized: the JavaScript Engine](https://dev.to/lydiahallie/javascript-visualized-the-javascript-engine-4cdf). Animated gifs showing how code is executed by the V8 engine (Chromium based browsers and Node.js engine)
- How is memory managed in Javascript? We have the luxury to not worry about memory management but we should be aware of how works to avoid common issues and potential memory leaks! Learn all about it in [How JavaScript works: memory management + how to handle 4 common memory leaks](https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-memory-management-how-to-handle-4-common-memory-leaks-3f28b94cfbec)
- Javascript single thread and the event loop. How concurrency is handled by Javascript: [How JavaScript works: Event loop and the rise of Async programming + 5 ways to better coding with async/await](https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-event-loop-and-the-rise-of-async-programming-5-ways-to-better-coding-with-2f077c4438b5)
- Do you want to dig even deeper? Check [How Browsers Work: Behind the scenes of modern web browsers](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/) for comprehensive details on parsing (HTML, CSS, JS), layout, painting and more.
- What is Bytecode? How V8 compiles for execution on [Understanding V8â€™s Bytecode](https://medium.com/dailyjs/understanding-v8s-bytecode-317d46c94775)
- Finally you can always check [V8 Engine blog](https://v8.dev/).

Enjoy!!!
