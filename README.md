I am a Staff+ Software Engineer building engaging user experiences and always learning! Passionate about web performance, React, and software architecture.

## Development

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

``` bash
npm run dev
```

### Deploy to production (manual)

You can create an optimized production build with:

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.
